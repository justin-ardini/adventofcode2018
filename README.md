# adventofcode2018

ðŸŽ„ Kotlin solutions to [Advent of Code 2018](https://adventofcode.com/2018/), with minimal use of external libraries. ðŸŽ„

These were completed as a Kotlin learning exercise, so don't expect idiomatic Kotlin.

## How to run

Run with `gradle run`, solutions are printed to console. Set the current day as the main class in
`build.gradle.kts`.
